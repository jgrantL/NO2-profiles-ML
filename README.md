# Efficient Prediction of NO2 Vertical Profiles Using ML

Welcome to my 8-month research project at a UC Berkeley atmospheric chemistry lab under the guidance of Dr. Ron Cohen! 

## Introduction

In order to get an accurate retrieval of NO2 data from a satellite, scientists require a priori knowledge about where NO2 generally exists in the atmosphere. This a prior knowledge comes in the form of a vertical profile (see picture below for both urban and rural NO2 vertical profiles over Atlanta, GA). 



## Repo Breakdown

- Code: This directory contains a series of R scripts and R markdown files used to acquire my data, merge relevent features, explore the data while answering some hypothesis questions, and code for building my published Shiny App web visualizations.

- Presentations:

- Data: This directory contains one file - my final, clean data frame used for exploratory data analysis.
